This cocktail calls for brandy, cucumber juice, Worcestershire sauce, and fresh lemon juice, and can be made with either vodka or Dry Gin, but will always be suitable with orange juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup.. Directions: Dash the crème de cacao on a cocktail glass, and add a splash of Angostura Bitters. Set aside. Combine ginger and Worcestershire in a shaker. Shake vigorously for a few minutes, and strain into a cocktail glass. Float the lemon juice on top of the drink, resting it on the rim. Sprinkle the top with crushed ice, if desired.. \n",
